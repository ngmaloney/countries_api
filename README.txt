Description:
------------
This module is a fork of the Drupal countries_api module. The original module seems to be abandoned. Rather than create yet another module I choose to maintain compatibility and put additional functionality within the module. It is 100% compatible but contains more features. The biggest change is it now includes a datbase of both countries and their regions.
